Project Description:

Our company is a consumer electronics retailer that specializes in selling AirPods, Apple's popular wireless earbuds. The website is the main point of sale for our products, and we aim to provide an easy, convenient, and user-friendly shopping experience for our customers.


The website features a comprehensive catalog of AirPods, along with their features, specifications, and pricing. We also offer a detailed comparison chart to help customers choose the right product, as well as reviews and ratings from previous customers.

Developers:

The development team consisted of two members:

Le Anh Tuan: Front-end Developer
Tran Lan Phuc: Front-end Developer

Web Design:

We designed the website using a mobile-first approach and implemented responsive design principles to ensure compatibility across devices. We used a simple and modern design with a focus on high-quality images and easy-to-read typography.

For the frontend development, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website. We tested the website thoroughly to ensure that it was functional and user-friendly.

During the development process, we worked according to the Agile methodology, using sprints to break down the work into manageable chunks and ensure that everyone was on the same page. We used Slack for communication and Trello to keep track of tasks and deadlines.

Overall, our goal was to create a website that was visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provided users with all the information they needed to plan their travel experience with the company.
